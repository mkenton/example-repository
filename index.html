    <div id="about">
      <p>Welcome to my first web creation. I am excited to build knowledge at FlatIron to apply to furture endeavors. As a start, I will share my proudest collaborative creation - the Night Lily. While a website (let alone my very first) probably can't capture the it's full glory, I am employing my "Prework" learnings in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to give you a small taste of what it is like to visit the Night Lily. </p>

      <h2>Night Lily Transformation</h2>
      <div id="about">
        <p> The Night Lily is far from a static object. During the day, its white fabric glistens in the sunlight. It takes the form of a bud, which occasioanlly blooms into a full 12-foot flower. It also can surprise its visitors with a soothing mist. At night, the Lily blooms into a visual explosion of light, color, and motion.</p>

      <h2>Never the Same Pattern</h2>
      <div id="about">
        <p>In my work with the The Night Lily, I combined animations created by our team with effects software and video techniques to create mesmerizing textures. Rather than show a pre-rendered video loop, I worked to create a visual display that never showed the exact same pattern twice. Below is a button configured to show you a snapshot of the Night Lily captured at a particular moment in time. I hope by using this button you can begin to imagine the experience our ever-evolving Night Lily creation. (Note: This may be a work in progress as I sharpen my HTML and Javascript skills!)
